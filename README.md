## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This project showed me how important might be essentials: inheritance , cascading and etc. - all that stuff can make your code smaller, more clean and understandable. While working with main section and recommendations i've noticed a kind of advanced topics i want to work with like responsive gaps or sizing. My next steps will be focused on repeating and practice.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me to understand how grids and their properties work in general. It is extremely useful for beginners like me.
